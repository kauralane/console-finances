# console-finances
## General
This application is a very basic web page, where the focus is purely on the javascript file - the key component of the webpage can be viewed within the console. 

The console displays 'financial analysis' using a dataset given in the original script file. It outlines the number of months in the dataset, the total profits/losses over that number of months, the average change in profit/loss month-on-month, and the month with the greatest profit, and greatest loss. 

My biggest challenge with this application was getting to the last stage (finding the greatest & smallest profits) before realising that the new array I created no longer included the months, which I needed. With online research and a tutoring session I managed to figure out how to ensure that my months were included in the new array as well as the numbers. As is seemingly always the case for me, as soon as I figured it out it seemed so simple!
